# Restaurant-Page

Project from The Odin Project boot camp that is focused on creating a dynamic Restaurant Webpage. This one was difficult and I learned a lot of new concepts by doing it.

This project taught me several things:
1. How to use NPM to initialize and install packages
2. How to install Webpack and write code in it
3. Import/Export Modules

Still needs better CSS but HTML and JavaScript parts are complete for full functionality.
